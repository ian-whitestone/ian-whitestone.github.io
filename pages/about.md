As I was studying Chemical Engineering at Queen's University, I started pursuing a career back home in Calgary, Alberta in the Oil & Gas industry. During one summer, I got thrown into the world of data science when I started trying to make money by using Python to optimize daily fantasy sports lineups. After the oil price crashed, I realized I should probably look for work in another industry. With a new found passion for data science, I started my career working for Capital One in Toronto as a data scientist. For close to three years, I worked on operational monitoring across the business, credit risk analysis, data infrastructure & risk models. Looking to experience work in another industry, I started working as a product data scientist for Shopify where I currently spends my days building ETL pipelines, doing product analytics, and building new data products to make it easier for merchants on Shopify to sell internationally.
