## ...this site

***Writing forces sharper understanding.***
*Writing is a great way to put pressure on your thinking: it’s hard to summarize something you don’t sharply understand. By trying to explain an idea, you’ll naturally try multiple framings, flesh out its edges, and see new connections.*

Andy's thinking above is the core driver behind this site. It's a place for me to share ideas and things I've worked on, and in the process of doing so, build a better understanding of the underlying principles or technologies at play.

## ...me

As I was studying Chemical Engineering at Queen's University, I started pursuing a career back home in Calgary, Alberta in the Oil & Gas industry. During one summer, I got thrown into the world of data science when I started trying to make money by using Python to optimize daily fantasy sports lineups. After the oil price crashed, I realized I should probably look for work in another industry. With a new found passion for all things data, I started my career working for Capital One in Toronto as a Data Scientist. For close to three years, I worked on operational monitoring across the business, credit risk analysis, OCR applications, data infrastructure & risk models. Looking to experience work in another industry, I started working as a Product Data Scientist for Shopify where I currently spend my days building ETL pipelines, doing product analytics, and building new data products to make it easier for merchants on Shopify to sell internationally.
