## ...this site

***Writing forces sharper understanding.***
*Writing is a great way to put pressure on your thinking: it’s hard to summarize something you don’t sharply understand. By trying to explain an idea, you’ll naturally try multiple framings, flesh out its edges, and see new connections.*

Andy's thinking is the core driver behind this site. It's a place for me to share ideas and things I've worked on, and in the process of doing so, build a better understanding of the underlying principles or technologies at play.

## ...me

I'm currently the co-founder of [SELECT](https://select.dev), a SaaS company focused on [Snowflake performance and cost optimization](https://select.dev/about). If you are trying to reduce your Snowflake bill, improve performance, or curious to learn more about Snowflake in general, don't hesitate to [email me](mailto:ian@select.dev?subject=Select&nbsp;Snowflake&nbsp;Optimization) - I'd be more than happy to chat!

Prior to starting SELECT, I led data teams at Shopify and worked as a data scientist at Capital One.
